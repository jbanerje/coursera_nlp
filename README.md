Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces

a) Perform sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and then na√Øve Bayes, 
b) Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships, and
c) Write a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbor search.
